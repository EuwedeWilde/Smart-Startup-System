    If you are seeing this, great! That means that you managed to get the frontend up and running. This is the documentation of the Smart Startup System or S3 (pronounced <em>"S-cubed"</em>) for short. This is an opensource socket switching system, the problem with most smart switching systems on the market is that they do not have an ethernet port and are not very configurable. This system changes that and is an upgrade in all regards (I am a bit biased). This documentation hopes to shed light on the making of the devices and how they work.
